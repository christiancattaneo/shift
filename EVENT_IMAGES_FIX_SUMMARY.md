# Event Images Fix Summary

## Issue Diagnosed
Event images were not displaying in the app due to:
1. Events in Firestore had only filename hashes in the `image` field (e.g., `79e95c91c6e4414e4cdf0ffda36d77d1793c6989f42bbf25efbb0c5bd9b01b7e.jpeg`)
2. These files didn't exist in Firebase Storage - they were never uploaded during migration
3. The app was trying to construct URLs from these non-existent files, resulting in 404 errors

## Fix Applied
1. Created `fix_event_images.js` script that:
   - Matched 43 local event images to Firestore events
   - Uploaded images to Firebase Storage with proper naming (using document IDs)
   - Updated 46 events with proper `imageUrl` and `firebaseImageUrl` fields

2. Updated `FirebaseDataModels.swift` to prioritize the new `imageUrl` field when loading event images

## Results
- ✅ 46 events now have working images (events that had matching local files)
- ❌ 196 events still don't have images (no local image files available)

## Events With Working Images
The following events now have images:
- Coffee & Chill June 21
- Run & Rave - Wellness Club
- Vibra Latin Fridays Luna
- Casa Blanca Luna White Party
- Cold Plunge Social Jacoby
- Toga N Yoga
- The Last Royal Blue Rave
- And 39 more...

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Test the app to confirm the 46 events now show images correctly
2. For events without images, consider:
   - Using placeholder images
   - Allowing event creators to upload new images
   - Fetching images from external sources

### Long-term Solution
1. Implement image upload functionality in the app for event creation
2. Store images with consistent naming: `events/{eventId}.{extension}`
3. Always store full Firebase Storage URLs in the `imageUrl` field

## Technical Details

### Firebase Storage Structure
```
events/
  ├── 106.jpeg         (First Thursday)
  ├── 110.jpeg         (512 Coffee Club)
  ├── 127.png          (Illfest)
  ├── 137.jpeg         (Leon Bridges - Red Rocks)
  └── ... (43 total event images)
```

### Firestore Document Structure
```javascript
{
  eventName: "Coffee & Chill June 21",
  venueName: "Central Machine Works",
  image: "219.jpeg",  // Just filename
  imageUrl: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/shift-12948.firebasestorage.app/o/events%2F219.jpeg?alt=media",
  firebaseImageUrl: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/shift-12948.firebasestorage.app/o/events%2F219.jpeg?alt=media"
}
```

### Swift Code Priority
The app now checks for images in this order:
1. `imageUrl` field (newly added)
2. `firebaseImageUrl` field
3. Document ID-based URL pattern
4. Legacy `image` field with conversion

## Storage Rules
Event images are publicly readable:
```
match /events/{filename} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}
```
