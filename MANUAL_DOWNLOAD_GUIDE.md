## 🚀 Step 2: Upload All Images

Once Firebase Storage is enabled, run:

```bash
# Test Firebase connection first
npm run test-firebase-connection

# Upload all 776 images
npm run upload-to-firebase
```

### **What the Upload Does:**
- ✅ **Uploads all images** to Firebase Storage
- 📁 **Organizes by type**: `profile_images/`, `event_images/`, `place_images/`
- 🔄 **Updates Firestore** documents with new Firebase URLs
- 📊 **Provides detailed progress** and success/failure counts

## 📋 Alternative: Manual Process

If you prefer to upload manually:

### **Option A: Firebase Console Upload**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Storage
2. Create folders: `profile_images`, `event_images`, `place_images`
3. Drag and drop images from `./all_adalo_images/` directories
4. Manually update Firestore document URLs

### **Option B: Use Downloaded Images Locally**
- Images are organized in `./all_adalo_images/`
- Each record has its own folder with image + JSON metadata
- Perfect for local development or custom upload processes

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Storage not enabled" Error**
- Go to Firebase Console → Storage → Get Started
- Follow the setup wizard

### **"Permission denied" Error**
- Check Firebase Storage security rules
